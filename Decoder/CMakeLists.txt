# `juce_generate_juce_header` will create a JuceHeader.h for a given target, which will be generated
# into your build tree. This should be included with `#include <JuceHeader.h>`. The include path for
# this header will be automatically added to the target. The main function of the JuceHeader is to
# include all your JUCE module headers; if you're happy to include module headers directly, you
# probably don't need to call this.

# `target_sources` adds source files to a target. We pass the target that needs the sources as the
# first argument, then a visibility parameter for the sources which should normally be PRIVATE.
# Finally, we supply a list of source files that will be built into the target. This is a standard
# CMake command.

# `target_compile_definitions` adds some preprocessor definitions to our target. In a Projucer
# project, these might be passed in the 'Preprocessor Definitions' field. JUCE modules also make use
# of compile definitions to switch certain features on/off, so if there's a particular feature you
# need that's not on by default, check the module header for the correct flag to set here. These
# definitions will be visible both to your code, and also the JUCE module code, so for new
# definitions, pick unique names that are unlikely to collide! This is a standard CMake command.

# If your target needs extra binary assets, you can add them here. The first argument is the name of
