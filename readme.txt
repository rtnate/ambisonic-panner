Note: Some Reaper-Templates distributed with this package require 3rd-party plugins. More information including download links can be found here: https://ambisonics.ch/post/icst-ambiplugins-templates

Hint: In case you have a previous version of the ICST AmbiPlugins installed, you might want to clean up the Reaper-Template-Folders manually before installing this version on top.
